        Someone once told me to always live for the little things in lite.live for 5am &#127774&nbsp;Sunrises and 5pm
        Sunsets,where you'll always see colors in the sky that don't usually belong.
        <pre> <i>       Live for road trips and bike rides, 
        with music in your ears&#127925and 
        wind in your hair.</i></pre> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live for
        days when you're surrounded by your favourite people,&nbsp;<q>who make you realite that the world is not a cold harsh
        place.</q>&nbsp; Live for the little things because they will make you realite this is waht life is about and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        this is what
        it means to be alive	&#127802
